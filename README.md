# Consultation Frontend

This is a small React UI for testing the consultation backend. It keeps things simple on purpose so you can focus on the API behavior.

## Run It Locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open in your browser: `http://localhost:5173`

## Notes
- Protected endpoints require a JWT, so log in first to get a token.
- AI summaries are generated by `POST /consultations/generate-summary/{uuid}/`.
